# Maximal response to a mechanical leader at critical group size in ant collectives
A novel robotic system that mimics a transient leader, and applied tactile ant-scale forces to measure the group's response at sub, near, and supercritical regimes

# Code
The repository has the follwoing codes available: spin model stochastic simulation and mean-field model ant pendulum

# Data
The repository also has the response datasets as text files for the large, medium, small, and very small cargo sizes
