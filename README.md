# Maximal response to a mechanical leader at critical group size in ant collectives
A novel robotic system that mimics a transient leader, and applied tactile ant-scale forces to measure the group's response at sub, near, and supercritical regimes

# Tracking code
This branch has openCV object detection code

# Simulation Code
This branch has the follwoing codes available: spin model stochastic simulation and mean-field model ant pendulum
